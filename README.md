# AJANDA

A ToDo App

## A project that helped me understand a lot of Flutter related topics.

An agenda where you can take notes so you don't forget what you need to do during the day.
You can see all your tasks on the main screen.
You can mark them complete and list them on another page. And you can list your to-do tasks on another page.
Your data is saved on your device and you can update and delete it as you wish. Meanwhile, the app gives you options.
It is a project open to development, I am waiting for your suggestions. Because I will continue to develop it.
