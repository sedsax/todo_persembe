# AJANDA

A ToDo App

## A project that helped me understand a lot of Flutter related topics.

- An agenda where you can take notes so you don't forget what you need to do during the day.
- You can see all your tasks on the main screen.
- You can mark them complete and list them on another page. And you can list your to-do tasks on another page.
- Your data is saved on your device and you can update and delete it as you wish. Meanwhile, the app gives you options.
- It is a project open to development, I am waiting for your suggestions. Because I will continue to develop it.
